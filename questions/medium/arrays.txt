Array Rotation: Write a function in a programming language of your choice to rotate an array of integers by a given number of positions to the right. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation is 2, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

Finding Duplicates: Given an array of integers, write an algorithm to find all the duplicates in the array. What is the time and space complexity of your solution?

ඞ

Largest Sum Subarray: Write a function to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in an array of integers. Provide both the subarray and the sum. For example, in the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the largest sum subarray is [4, -1, 2, 1] with a sum of 6.

ඞ

Merge Two Sorted Arrays: Given two sorted arrays, write a function to merge them into a single sorted array. What is the time complexity of your solution?

ඞ

Array Transposition: Implement a function to transpose a given 2D matrix represented as an array of arrays. For example, if the input is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], the output should be [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]].
